# OnMovie APP
App I developed from scratch to my own Startup. Our business is intermediate the relationship between video editors and clients (mainly content creators) who need professional videos.
In this app client can put the informations about the video, send audio to editor explaining what he/she wants and all other necessary informations. After that will upload the assets (videos, photos, documents, etc).
At the end, our app will automatically calculate the budget of this video (without necessity of talk to editor). After payment, one of our editor partners will edit your video.
At the moment editor accept your project, chat is open to conversation between client and editor.
When finish, editor will upload the video and client can choose if it's approved or there is any modification necessity.

All inside app! No need of any platform outside.

This is OnMovie!
